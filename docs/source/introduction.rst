The OpenAIRE Guidelines for Software Repository Managers 1.0 provide
orientation for software repository managers to define and implement their local software
management policies according to the requirements of the OpenAIRE - Open Access
Infrastructure for Research in Europe. These guidelines are intended to provide indications on how to cite software products in order to make them first citizens of the scholarly communication ecosystem. 

The Guidelines take inspiration from DataCite, on the side of citation metadata, and from the OpenMinTed SHARE-OMTD software guidelines, available at https://guidelines.openminted.eu/guidelines_for_providers_of_sw_resources/recommended_schema_for_sw_resources.html
