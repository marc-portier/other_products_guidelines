The OpenAIRE Guidelines for Other Research Products (ORP) Repository Managers 1.0 provide
orientation for repository managers to define and implement their local 
management policies according to the requirements of the OpenAIRE - Open Access
Infrastructure for Research in Europe. These guidelines are intended to provide indications on how to cite ORPs products. 

By implementing these Guidelines, repository managers will enable authors to incorporate their research product into the OpenAIRE infrastructure for discoverability and utilizing value-added services provided by the OpenAIRE portal. The metadata of the products should be included in the OpenAIRE information space, and exposed when the research artefact is related to an open access publication e.g. referred by an article. 
By implementing the OpenAIRE Guidelines, the creation of enhanced publications and building the stepping-stones for a linked data infrastructure for research is facilitated.
Exposure and visibility of content from a range of European repositories will be significantly increased when a common and interoperable approach is taken as well as adhering to existing guidelines. OpenAIRE is happy to assist in adherence to these guidelines. This compatibility will lead to future interoperability between research infrastructures, and structured metadata is of benefit to individual data repositories and the scholarly community at large.

The Guidelines take inspiration from DataCite, on the side of citation metadata, and from the `OpenMinTed SHARE-OMTD <https://guidelines.openminted.eu/guidelines_for_providers_of_sw_resources/recommended_schema_for_sw_resources.html>`_ software guidelines.
